# Recipe Recommendation Web Application
Overview
A recipe recommendation web application built with **Flask** and **Python**.  
It suggests recipes based on user-provided ingredients, dietary preferences, and cooking time.  
The app also displays real food images from the **Food-41** dataset (downloaded manually from Kaggle).

# Features

- Search recipes by ingredients  
- Filter by diet type (vegetarian, vegan, etc.) and time  
- View detailed recipe pages with images  
- Automatically loads Food-41 image dataset from Kaggle  
- Lightweight recommendation engine using TF-IDF and cosine similarity 
- Uploadimage to get food name ( AI train Mobilenet CNN model)

# ðŸ”‘ Dataset Setup (Manual Download)

- This app uses the Food-41 dataset for food images.

1. Go to Food-41 Dataset on Kaggle
2. Click Download (requires a Kaggle account).
3. Extract the downloaded archive and locate the file:
   - ./dataset/food_c101_n1000_r384x384x3.h5
   

- ðŸ›‘ Notes: The .h5 dataset file is large (~600 MB). Do not push it to GitHub.
            Add this line to your .gitignore:
```bash
dataset/*.h5
```
- Used extract_imagesFromh5.py to extract all image from .h5 to appear corectly.
# Run the Application
```bash
python main.py

```
- Open your browser at: http://127.0.0.1:5000/
