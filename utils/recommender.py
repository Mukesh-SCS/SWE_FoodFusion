# ================================================================================
# DESCRIPTION:
#     This module implements a simple recipe recommendation system based on
#     text similarity. It compares user-provided ingredients with recipe data
#     using TF-IDF (Term Frequencyâ€“Inverse Document Frequency) and cosine similarity.
#
# USAGE:
#     Import and call the recommend() function:
#         from utils.recommender import recommend
#         recommendations = recommend("chicken tomato", recipes)
#
# OUTPUTS:
#     - Returns a list of recipe dictionaries ranked by similarity score.
#
# ARGUMENTS:
#     - query (str): User input ingredients.
#     - recipes (list): List of recipe dictionaries.
#     - top_n (int): Number of top recommendations to return.
#
# Author Info: Code written by SWE_FOODFUSION Team

    Function: recommend
    Purpose: Suggest top recipes based on ingredient similarity.
    Inputs:
        query (str): User input ingredients (e.g., "chicken onion garlic").
        recipes (list): List of recipe dictionaries from the dataset.
        top_n (int): Maximum number of recipes to return (default = 5).
    Outputs:
        Returns a list of recipe dictionaries most similar to the user's query.
    Steps:
        1. Combine ingredients from each recipe into text strings.
        2. Append the user's query as a new document.
        3. Use TF-IDF vectorization to represent all text numerically.
        4. Compute cosine similarity between the query and all recipes.
        5. Rank recipes by similarity score and return the top matches.
